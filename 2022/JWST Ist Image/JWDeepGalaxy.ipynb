    "## Turnover Point\n",
    "The angular diameter distance {\\displaystyle d_{A}}d_{A} reaches a maximum at a redshift {\\displaystyle z=z_{t}}{\\displaystyle z=z_{t}} (in the Î›CDM model, this occurs at {\\displaystyle z_{t}\\approx 1.5}{\\displaystyle z_{t}\\approx 1.5}), such that the slope of {\\displaystyle d_{A}(z)}{\\displaystyle d_{A}(z)} changes sign at {\\displaystyle z=z_{t}}{\\displaystyle z=z_{t}}, or {\\displaystyle \\partial _{z}d_{A}>0~\\forall z<z_{t}}{\\displaystyle \\partial _{z}d_{A}>0~\\forall z<z_{t}}, {\\displaystyle \\partial _{z}d_{A}<0\\forall z>z_{t}}{\\displaystyle \\partial _{z}d_{A}<0\\forall z>z_{t}}. In reference to its appearance when plotted, {\\displaystyle z_{t}}z_{t} is sometimes referred to as the turnover point. Practically, this means that if we look at objects at increasing redshift (and thus objects that are increasingly far away) those at greater redshift will span a smaller angle on the sky only until {\\displaystyle z=z_{t}}{\\displaystyle z=z_{t}}, above which the objects will begin to span greater angles on the sky at greater redshift. The turnover point seems paradoxical because it contradicts our intuition that the farther something is, the smaller it will appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The turnover point occurs because of the expansion of the universe and the finite speed of light. Because the universe is expanding, objects that are now very distant were once much nearer. Because the speed of light is finite, the light reaching us from these now-distant objects must have left them long ago when they were nearer and spanned a larger angle on the sky. The turnover point can therefore tell us about the rate of expansion of the universe (or the relationship between the expansion rate and the speed of light if we do not assume the latter to be constant)."
