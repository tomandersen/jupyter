    "# Pilot waves from General Relativity\n",
    "## Non-local, FTL, non-signalling, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "The pilot wave theory as envisioned by de Broglie, enhanced and re popularized by Bohm, and realized in the lab by Yves Couder, John Bush and others is a base for a new quantum mechanics - an explanation of quantum behavoir if you will - that shows great promise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper, we outline a way to potentially build a quantum potential, and the reaction mechanism of particles from General Relativity alone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incentives for developing a theory of pilot wave mechanics from General Relativity (GR):\n",
    "    * GR has a well defined physical and mathematical structure\n",
    "    * GR applies to all energy - (EM is only for charged particles, etc)\n",
    "    * May connect with the search for quantum gravity (might *be* QG) \n",
    "    * GR has a lot of free unused bandwidth - and nature tends to use bandwith\n",
    "    * No one seems to look into this avenue. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Potential problems with a theory of pilot wave mechanics from General Relativity (GR):\n",
    "    * GR is weak (*we will see that this is not the case*)\n",
    "    * QM takes place in a high (infinite?) dimensional Hilbert Space, GR has 4 dimensions\n",
    "    * GR is explictly local, with a speed limit of c, and thus will not generate Bell violations\n",
    "    * GR is weak (*its going to be hard to break that dogma!*)\n",
    "    * Particles are explained by the Standard Model, not Gravity.\n",
